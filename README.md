# BST-270-Project

#### Individual project for BST 270 Reproducible Data Science at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in winter 2023

Author: Lauren Flynn

Contact: laurenflynn@hsph.harvard.edu

Here we will reproduce two plots from a fivethirtyeight article titled ["Dear Mona, Which State Has The Worst Drivers?"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-state-has-the-worst-drivers/). This article has a corresponding GitHub which contains the [data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bad-drivers). However, it does not contain the code of data wrangling or visualization generation. We will not attempt to reproduce the wrangling; however, the original data can be found at the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

##### How to Use

To reproduce two of the graphics from the project, please run the file `/source/analysis.Rmd`. It can be knit in Rstudio to produce the html output. The data will be downloaded from fivethirtyeight's data/bad-drivers GitHub as part of the script, so there is no need to download the data manually. The data, taken from file bad-drivers.csv from the repository, is accessed in raw form at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/bad-drivers/bad-drivers.csv.
